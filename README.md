# Problem Statement
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a restaurant review is positive or negative based on the text.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 1,000 restaurant reviews, each labeled as either "Positive" (1) or "Negative" (0). It has two columns:
1. Review: The text of the restaurant review.
2. Liked: A 0 or 1 indicating if the review is negative (0) or positive (1).
There are an equal number of positive and negative reviews.

## Code Explanation
The Jupyter Notebook `Restaurant_Reviews.ipynb` does the following:
1. Loads and explores the dataset.
2. Cleans and preprocesses the review text data.
3. Converts text data to numerical features.
4. Splits data into training and testing sets.
5. Trains two machine learning models:
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
6. Evaluates models using accuracy, confusion matrices, and visualizations.
7. Provides a function to predict sentiment of new reviews.

## Requirements
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `Sentiment_Analysis_on_Restaurant_Reviews_AI.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment or any Python IDE.
3. Make sure the `Restaurant_Reviews.csv` dataset file is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the machine learning models (Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier), and evaluate their performance.
5. You can modify the input reviews in the last cell of the notebook to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of new restaurant reviews.

## Results
The code trains and evaluates two machine learning models for sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews:

**Random Forest Classifier**
- Testing Accuracy: 74.50%

**Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** 
- Testing Accuracy: 78.00%

The SVC model achieves a higher testing accuracy of 78%, compared to 74.50% for the Random Forest Classifier. The confusion matrices and visualizations for both models are provided in the notebook.

Overall, the SVC model performs better on this dataset, with a lower difference between training and testing accuracy, indicating better generalization.
